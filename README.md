# RED-Microbit-Robot-Python
Contains some code I quickly wrote for a little microbit controlled robot in class. 

Download this code onto both the controller microbit and the microbit on the kitronik robot and power both to work. Use the controller to steer the robot. A left, B right AB forwards. 

I'll write a longer and more explanatory README if I get an opportunity.
